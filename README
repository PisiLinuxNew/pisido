And also to be a simple program to make packages from source code for end users.

    ./pisido

If you want to install it:

    make install

Also you can make a pisi package with PiSiDo to install itself :)


Language Files
--------------
If you want to add a new language file, you can make a pisi package which will install
pisido_*.qm file to the /usr/share/pisido/translations/ and help_*.pdf file to
/usr/share/pisido/help/. PiSiDo is searching pisido_*.qm files for the language selection.
